# Academic-Progression-Marker

established a Python application to forecast university students' academic advancement results based on their credit scores. Staff members can enter pass, defer, and fail credits for many students in this program, which also ensures data validity and determines the appropriate progression consequence (progress, trailing, module retriever, or exclude). Among the features that have been implemented are lists and dictionaries for data storage, effective use of conditional expressions, and error handling for improper input types and out-of-range values. The tool also saves student data in a text file for later use and creates a histogram visualization of progression outcomes.
